# SpaceManBot
This is StarFallenJax's open-source Discord.py Bot. Now on Github!

This bot runs on Repl.it, which is a free online code editor. It can do a lot of things so I decided to host my bot there so I didn't have to have my computer on.

In order for most commands to work, you'll need to install these packages

Note: I will redo a lot of code when I move this to discord.js. Rest in peace discord.py

Anyway, that's it for now, I'll be updating this as I create more stuff. Thanks for checking this out!
