# SpaceManBot
This is SpaceManJax's open source Discord Bot. Now on Github!

This bot runs on Repl.it, a free, online code editor. It can do a lot of things so I decided to host my bot here so I didn't have to have my computer on.

In order for most commands to work, you'll need to install these packages

Anyway, that's it for now, I'll be updating this as I create more stuff. Thanks for checking this out!
